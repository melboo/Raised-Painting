Met + Parsons Museum Accessibility Collaboration Workshop
===

Metropolitan Museum, Parsons School for Design
Fall, 2013

## Workshop

What expectations do people with disabilities have when they visit museums? How are museums adapting new technologies to better serve our visitors, whatever their abilities and interests? How can the Met take a leadership role in introducing standards for inclusivity to the next generation of museum technologists? These are some of the questions we asked ourselves when embarking on the Met + Parsons Museum Accessibility Collaboration Workshop.

## Raised Painting

Raised Painting is about discovering new ways to interpret art, using technology to engineer a playful, educational, and transformative experience. Raised Painting is an interactive puzzle experience that allows the user to piece together the painting, and gives them spatial reference.
